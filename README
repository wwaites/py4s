Experimental bindings and C client library for 4store by
Copyright 2009 William Waites <wwaites@gmail.com>. Distributed
as with 4store under terms of the GNU GPL v3. See the file 
COPYING for details.

The main branch of 4store only has support for one client
process at a time. This means you cannot import data or run
the http server at the same time as using these python bindings.
The branch at http://github.com/wwaites/4store has support
for multiple clients but should be considered to be 
bleeding edge code.

Building this package requires Cython from
http://www.cython.org 

You need version 0.12 of greater of Cython, the version you
get with pip or easy_install is fine, the version you get
with apt on debian/ubuntu is too old.

See the directory tests for some examples of usage. They can
be run with

	nosetests --verbosity=2 -s

Make sure you have an instance of the 4store backend running
serving a KB called py4s_test.
